After building printing and handwiring designs found online I wanted to try modeling a keyboard from the ground up. 

This is the slab100. It has some issues that I hope to revisit one day but for right now I'm considering it done. 

I was typing this post with the slab100 until it started double firing and multiple keys stopped working. This is probably because of the wiring. This time I wanted to try the super thing "magnet wire" because you can melt off the sheilding instead of having to strip cable in multiple places. 

Board used: YD-RP2040 running Circuit Python and KMK firmware.
